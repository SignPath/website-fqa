<h2 id="1-definitions">1. Definitions</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Agreement</strong> refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the SignPath Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://about.signpath.io/privacy-policy/">https://about.signpath.io/privacy-policy/</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</li>
  <li><strong>Service</strong> refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by SignPath.</li>
  <li><strong>Website</strong> refers to the SignPath website located at www.signpath.io, and all services, and products provided by SignPath at or through the Website. It also refers to SignPath-owned subdomains of signpath.io.</li>
  <li><strong>SignPath, We, and Us</strong> refer to SignPath GmbH, Werdertorgasse 14, 1010 Vienna, Austria, as well as its affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
  <li><strong>The User, You, and Your</strong> refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. An “Account” represents your legal relationship with SignPath. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on SignPath.</li>
  <li><strong>Organizations</strong> refers to shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrator</strong> refers to the owner of an Organization who has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it.</li>
  <li><strong>Content</strong> refers to software artifacts, certificates, private keys, audit logs, system configuration settings within an Organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-account-terms">2. Account Terms</h2>

<h3 id="21-account-controls">2.1 Account Controls</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You retain ultimate administrative control over your Account.</li>
  <li>The Administrator of an Organization has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, the Administrator can manage User access to the Organization’s Content. An Organization may have multiple Administrators. If you are the Administrator of an Organization, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="22-required-information">2.2 Required Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the sign up process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you opt for a paid subscription, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="23-account-requirements">2.3 Account Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on our Service:
    <ul>
      <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
      <li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account.</li>
      <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="24-account-security">2.4 Account Security</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. SignPath cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="25-responsibility-for-your-content">2.5 Responsibility for Your Content</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You are solely responsible for the Content you upload and processed through the Service. Depending on your subscription plan, we may scan your Content for malware and refuse to process and store them. However, we do not take any responsibility for the correctness or the completeness of this scan. You are still solely responsible for any harm resulting from any Content that you upload, process or make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="26-confidentiality">2.6 Confidentiality</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SignPath considers the Content of the Organization to be confidential to the Users within the Organization. SignPath will protect the Content of the Organization from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="27-access">2.7 Access</h3>

<ul>
  <li>SignPath employees may only access your Content in the following situations:
    <ul>
      <li>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If SignPath accesses the Content of your Organization for support reasons, we will only do so with the Administrator’s consent and knowledge.</li>
      <li>When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of SignPath’s systems and Service.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-acceptable-use">3. Acceptable Use</h2>

    </ul>

      <li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with SignPath servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on SignPath’s servers through automated means, or to access SignPath’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization;</li>
      <li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with SignPath, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site’s purpose; or</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="35-scraping">3.5 Scraping</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="36-excessive-service-use">3.6 Excessive Service Use</h3>

  <li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to SignPath via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account’s access to the API.
